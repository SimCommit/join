Here, we'll provide an\n    overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.\n\n  \n    What is Join?\n    Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of\n      their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.\n\n    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning \"billboard\", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit\n      work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage\n      their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.\n\n    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive\n      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent\n      availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.\n  \n\n  \n    How to use it\n    Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:\n\n    \n      1.\n      Exploring the Board\n      When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four\n        default lists: \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", \"Await feedback\" and \"Done\".\n    \n\n    \n      2.\n      Creating Contacts\n      In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the \"Contacts\" section, click on \"New\n        contact\", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can\n        interact with the tasks on the board.\n    \n\n    \n      3.\n      Adding Cards\n      Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the\n        \"+\" button under the appropriate list to create a new card.

Here, we\\'ll provide an    overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.      What is Join?    Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of      their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning \"billboard\", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit      work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage      their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent      availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.        How to use it    Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:          1.      Exploring the Board      When you log in to Join, you\\'ll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four        default lists: \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", \"Await feedback\" and \"Done\".              2.      Creating Contacts      In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the \"Contacts\" section, click on \"New        contact\", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can        interact with the tasks on the board.              3.      Adding Cards      Now that you\\'ve added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the        \"+\" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task        name, description, due date, assignees, etc.              4.      Moving Cards      As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the        card from one list to another.              5.      Deleting Cards      Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the \"Done\" list or delete it. Deleting a card will        permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is        irreversible.            Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board      reflects the current state of your project.    Have more questions about Join?

The use of our Kanban project management tool \"Join\"\n      is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal data (such as name, address, or email\n      address) is collected, this is done on a voluntary basis. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without\n      your explicit consent.\n      \n      We process your data exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation\n      (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). Technical and organizational measures are in place to\n      ensure your data is protected against unauthorized access, loss, or manipulation.\n    \n    \n      When you use Join, certain technical data (such as your IP address, browser type, and access times) may be\n      automatically collected for security and statistical purposes. This data is stored separately from other personal\n      data and is not used to identify you as an individual. Log files are deleted regularly in accordance with legal\n      requirements.\n    \n    \n      If you contact us (e.g., via email), your information will be stored for the purpose of processing your inquiry\n      and for possible follow-up questions. We will not share this information without your consent.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    Legal Basis for Data Processing\n    \n      The processing of your personal data is based on Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Data processing is permitted if:\n    \n    \n      you have given your explicit consent,\n      it is necessary for the performance of a contract,\n      it is required by law, or\n      it is necessary to protect legitimate interests and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding\n        interest in the non-disclosure of your data.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    Your Rights and Contact\n    \n      You have the right to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose\n      of data processing at any time, free of charge. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or\n      deletion of your data. If you have given consent for data processing, you may revoke it at any time with effect\n      for the future.\n      \n      You also have the right to data portability and to object to certain types of data processing, such as direct\n      marketing. If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint\n      with the responsible supervisory authority in Germany.\n      \n      For questions regarding data protection or to exercise your rights, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].\n      \n      Please note that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by email) may have security\n      vulnerabilities.

The use of our Kanban project management tool \"Join\"      is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal data (such as name, address, or email      address) is collected, this is done on a voluntary basis. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without      your explicit consent.            We process your data exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation      (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). Technical and organizational measures are in place to      ensure your data is protected against unauthorized access, loss, or manipulation.              When you use Join, certain technical data (such as your IP address, browser type, and access times) may be      automatically collected for security and statistical purposes. This data is stored separately from other personal      data and is not used to identify you as an individual. Log files are deleted regularly in accordance with legal      requirements.              If you contact us (e.g., via email), your information will be stored for the purpose of processing your inquiry      and for possible follow-up questions. We will not share this information without your consent.            Legal Basis for Data Processing          The processing of your personal data is based on Article 6(1) of the GDPR. Data processing is permitted if:              you have given your explicit consent,      it is necessary for the performance of a contract,      it is required by law, or      it is necessary to protect legitimate interests and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding        interest in the non-disclosure of your data.            Your Rights and Contact          You have the right to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose      of data processing at any time, free of charge. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or      deletion of your data. If you have given consent for data processing, you may revoke it at any time with effect      for the future.            You also have the right to data portability and to object to certain types of data processing, such as direct      marketing. If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint      with the responsible supervisory authority in Germany.

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nExample :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nExample :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nExample :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nExample :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nExample :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the Angular CLI Overview and Command
