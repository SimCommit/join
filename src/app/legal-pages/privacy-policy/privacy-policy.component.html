    <h2>Data Protection Information</h2>
    <p>
      We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. The use of our Kanban project management tool "Join" is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal data (such as name, address, or email address) is collected, this is done on a voluntary basis. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit consent.
      <br><br>
      We process your data exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). Technical and organizational measures are in place to ensure your data is protected against unauthorized access, loss, or manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use Join, certain technical data (such as your IP address, browser type, and access times) may be automatically collected for security and statistical purposes. This data is stored separately from other personal data and is not used to identify you as an individual. Log files are deleted regularly in accordance with legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you contact us (e.g., via email), your information will be stored for the purpose of processing your inquiry and for possible follow-up questions. We will not share this information without your consent.

      <li>it is necessary for the performance of a contract,</li>
      <li>it is required by law, or</li>

    <h2>Your Rights and Contact</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing at any time, free of charge. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or deletion of your data. If you have given consent for data processing, you may revoke it at any time with effect for the future.
      <br><br>
      You also have the right to data portability and to object to certain types of data processing, such as direct marketing. If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority in Germany.
